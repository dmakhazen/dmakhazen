### Hi!

I am passionate about working with data and conducting research. I have hands-on experience with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, Sklearn, and other tools. I strive for professional growth and aim to contribute to the evolving ML community.

Here are a few highlights of my experience:
- 🔍 Analyzing tabular data
- 📊 Hypothesis testing
- 🤖 Creating ML models

At the moment I am working on my project to bring the cinema revenue prediction model to production.

I would be delighted to join an active team in the ML/DS field and I am available for remote work. If you have any exciting projects or collaboration opportunities, please feel free to reach out to me.
